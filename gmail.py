        Todayâ€™s lecture covered the core principles of machine learning. We began with a recap of supervised vs. unsupervised learning, noting that supervised learning relies on labeled datasets, whereas unsupervised learning detects patterns without labeled data.
        Key examples of supervised learning included decision trees and support vector machines (SVMs), each with their own tradeoffs in interpretability and performance. We delved into the mathematics behind SVMs and margin maximization.
        The class also learned about unsupervised methods like k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), both useful in dimensionality reduction and exploratory analysis.
        A brief overview of neural networks was introduced, highlighting the role of activation functions and backpropagation. Students were encouraged to explore frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
        Assignment 4 is due next Friday and covers implementing a basic regression model. The next class will review performance metrics like RMSE and classification accuracy.
